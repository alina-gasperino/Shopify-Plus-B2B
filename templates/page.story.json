        "content1": "In 2004, registered nurse Alice Benedetto found herself incredibly frustrated as she walked down the grocery aisles with her 2-year-old son. Every snack her son reached for was loaded with sugar. It was then that Alice knew there had to be a better solution. Armed with her mixing bowl, a dedication to health, and a New York City grit, Alice found a way. She began making vegan snacks in her kitchen from nuts, fruits, and seeds, and word quickly got out that there was a delicious way to eat nutritious food. Kids began ditching their sugary snacks in favor of Alice‚Äôs treats and the neighborhood parents kept asking about this magical snack that was keeping their kids away from sugar.",
        "content2": "It was then that Raw Rev was born. With a focus on creating snacks that are as delicious as they are nutritious, Raw Rev is a beacon for those who believe healthy & happy should never be mutually exclusive. Because for us, ‚Äúraw‚Äù is an attitude ‚Äì a bold outlook on life and living it full of flavor. Join us in our mission to rewrite the rulebook on what nutrition should taste like.",

People were soaking raw organic cashews in bathtubs and hosting basement plant-based potlucks in secret Gotham locations!¬† During this time her entrepreneurial mind started dreaming up the beginnings of her first product line appropriately named: Raw Revolution.¬† Insiders always knew us as ‚ÄúRaw Rev‚Äù, so we decided to shorten it!<\/p>"
